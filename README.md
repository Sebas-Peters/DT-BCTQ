# DT-BCTQ
<h2>The BCTQ questionnaire is filled in by patients with peripheral nerve conditions to gain insight into the symptoms and functioning of the affected area. DW Levine has developed the questionnaire. More information on the questionnaire can be found <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2474-7-78">here</a>.</h2>

<h2>On this website, you can find a demo of the decision tree version of the BCTQ questionnaire developed by Jansen et al. 2019. This version was developed to allow for faster, easier completion of the BCTQ. Based on the answer you give to every question, the most discriminating question is asked next. This way, the final scores can be calculated by filling in only 6 of the 18 questions. The details of the questionnaire development can be found <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09638288.2019.1566407">here</a>. The DT-BCTQ has high inter-version reliability and agreement with the original BCTQ, as found by Peters et al. Details on inter-version reliability and agreement, as well as the questionnaire structure for implementation, are available here.</h2>
